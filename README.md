# Hi, I'm Maanav Koladia!

I am a student at the University of Texas at Austin, pursuing a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a focus on Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems Design, as well as a second degree in Pure Mathematics.  

I am passionate about embedded systems because they allow me to combine my love for problem-solving and technology to create tangible, impactful solutions. Feel free to explore some of the projects Iâ€™m proud of below:
